## The goal is to make a physics engine that does some basic mathematical calculation on bodies.

### **Objectives** :
>```
    1.Basic Object Reperesentation
        -Create a class for rigid body.
        -Add basic methods
        
>```
    2.Implement basic physics calculations
        -Integrate motion equations
        -Apply forces
    
>  
    3.Implement Collision Detection
        -Bounding volumes
        -Collision checking
        
>    
    4.Implement Collision Response
        -Basic response
        -Impulse calculation
    
>```
    5.Visualize the simulation
        -Render Objects
        -debugging Visualization


*The fifth point i.e. the Visual simulation is not he part of this project.*
*I will find workaround to do the visualization or i am completely neglecting it*
