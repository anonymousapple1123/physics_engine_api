Euler integration method for solving differential equations

In mathematics there are several types of ordinary differential equations (ODE), like linear, 
separable, or exact differential equations, which are solved analytically, giving an exact solution.
This means that there is a specific method to be applied in order to extract a general exact solution.

In practice, most of the differential equation do not have a standard form and can not be solved with
analytic methods, which means we can not find a general solution y(x). This is the case for most of the
differential equations derived from physical models (mechanical, electrical, thermal, etc.).
