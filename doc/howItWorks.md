Collision Detection & Resolution:

Create a new module (e.g., Collision.h and Collision.cpp) to add algorithms for detecting intersections
 between bodies.
Implement a collision response system that calculates impulses, friction, and restitution.
Rotational Dynamics:

Extend RigidBody to include angular properties and modify the integration step to account for rotations.
Create a simple math module for 2D rotation (or use quaternions/matrices for 3D).
Advanced Integration Methods:

Implement more accurate integration techniques to improve stability and realism, especially for larger 
time steps.
Constraints and Joints:

Develop a module to manage various constraints (e.g., distance joints, revolute joints) and solve them 
with iterative solvers.
Visualization & Debugging:

Use a graphics library to visualize the simulation in real time, which is especially helpful when 
developing collision or constraint systems.
Optimization:

Consider spatial partitioning (like quadtrees) in the collision module to improve performance with many objects.
